                        The logo of the Emirates Schools Establishment “Ta’leem”, meaning “Education” in Arabic and
                        written
                        «تعليم», reflects the main pillar of what we do to educate our students in all public schools,
                        aiming at
                        refining and shaping their skills and knowledge and encouraging them to a culture of lifelong
                        learning.
                    </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The logo is a combination of the powerful effect of “the seal” and how we are going to positively
                    impact
                    our
                    students, and the importance of “writing”, being one of the most prominent means of communication.
                    The
                    logo
                    also resembles the significance of preserving our ancestors’ legacy and passing on the science and
                    knowledge... Without it, we would have not reached where we are... And through it, we will lay out
                    the
                    features of a brighter and more creative future.
